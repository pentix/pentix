### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„

I'm Patrick, currently a CS student at ETH ZÃ¼rich. I'm generally
interested in Software Engineering and System Operations, especially fault-tolerant distributed and high availability systems.

Here you'll find some of my projects that I've been working on
in the past years or during my time at ETH.

Some are still active projects, however I also do have a lot
of unrealised ideas I could not fully pursue yet.
