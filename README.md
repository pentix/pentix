### Hi there 👋😄

I'm Patrick, currently a CS student at ETH Zürich. I'm generally
interested in Software Engineering and System Operations, especially fault-tolerant distributed and high availability systems.

Here you'll find some of my projects that I've been working on
in the past years or during my time at ETH.

Some are still active projects, however I also do have a lot
of unrealised ideas I could not fully pursue yet.

⚙️ [pentix/qjournalctl](https://github.com/pentix/qjournalctl)

A multi-platform, Qt-based frontend for systemd's journalctl command.
Accepting local as well as remote (SSH) data sources.

⚙️ [pentix/densor](https://github.com/pentix/densor)

An approach to realize a service monitoring system as a distributed system, relying on modern protocols such as TLS1.3. By far not completed, work in progress!
